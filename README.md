## Why NEXT.js, Tailwind CSS, and RecoilJS?

We chose NEXT.js as our frontend framework because it provides server-side rendering, which improves the performance and SEO of our application. It also has built-in support for TypeScript, which makes our code more reliable and easier to maintain.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps us style our components quickly and consistently. It also has a large community and great documentation, so we can easily find solutions to any styling issues we encounter.

RecoilJS is a state management library that helps us manage the state of our application in a simple and scalable way. It's lightweight, easy to use, and integrates well with React components.

Please note that the Spotify player will only work if your account is in premium. Also, the terms of use in Spotify Web API do not allow us to enable playback for free accounts.
